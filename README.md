Problem Statement-Certain urban areas become significantly hotter than others due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, exacerbated by pollution and poor urban planning. While macro-level solutions exist, micro-level planning tools are rare.

Solutions:Our Website CoolSphere tackles the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect by visualizing hotspots on a heatmap and suggesting mitigation strategles like tree planting and green roofs. It crowdsources data through user-uploaded photos and surveys, while gamification elements like points and badges encourage participation. The platform empowers citizens to take action, provides real-time localized data, and helps mitigate UHI cost-effectively, fostering community engagement and supporting better urban planning.
